# Growtopia Item Database
A web app for finding how to make items. Most item information is on the Wiki already, I know, but I think Wikis are pretty bad at actually encoding data in a useful way. By starting with data, I should be able to produce a tree of item dependencies, etc.

I haven't put this online anywhere yet, it's way too early.

I'm gradually filling in the item data. It's messy, but once I have it in a decent shape, it might be useful for someone else too.

# TODO:

- List of items
	- By name
	- By rarity

- Make things look nice
	- Images
	- Current colours are the WORST.

- Enter everything! UGH
	- Image indexes
	- Item data

- Have items spawned in a world link to their blast
